## OAuth2 Configuration (Deprecated)

It is now preferred to configure alfred-bitbucket with App passwords, but if you need to configure it with OAuth, here are the old instructions: [Generate BitBucket Consumer](https://github.com/nicklayb/alfred-bitbucket/blob/5b3051f3b0d21da9ecff2bfc6105107cb387f11d/README.md#generate-bitbucket-consumer)

## plist Configuration (Deprecated)

It is now preferred to configure the alfred-bitbucket variables through the workflow preferences. If you need to configure directly through the plist, here are the old instructions: [Through the plist file](https://github.com/nicklayb/alfred-bitbucket/blob/5b3051f3b0d21da9ecff2bfc6105107cb387f11d/README.md#through-the-plist-file)
